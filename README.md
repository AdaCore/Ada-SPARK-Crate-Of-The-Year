# Ada/SPARK Crate Of The Year Award

## The challenge

We’re calling on developers across the globe to grow the ecosystem of [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev) Ada and SPARK software and are offering $6,000 in total prizes. Why? Well, the Ada programming language was designed from its inception to be used in applications where safety and security are of the utmost importance and with the increased need for trustworthy software, we want to encourage the use of Ada/SPARK.

We want you to demonstrate your inventiveness and build safe, secure and reliable software that matters.

## The Technology

[Alire](https://alire.ada.dev) is a catalog of ready-to-use Ada/SPARK libraries plus a command-line tool (`alr`) to obtain, build, and incorporate them into your own projects. It aims to fulfill a similar role to Rust’s `cargo` or OCaml’s `opam`.

## Prizes

We are giving away thousands of dollars in prizes to the best Alire crate in 3 categories:
 - $2,000 for the Ada Crate Of The Year
 - $2,000 for the SPARK Crate Of The Year
 - $2,000 for the Embedded Crate Of The Year

Our judges are going to pick the best qualifying projects based on the judging criteria outlined in the rules section.
