# Terms and Conditions
				
## Purpose

These Terms and Conditions govern the first edition of “Ada/SPARK Crate Of The Year” (“the Competition”), a programming contest that rewards original “Crates” that use the Ada and/or SPARK language(s). No purchase is required to participate in the Competition and there is no entry fee.

## Organizer

The Competition is organized by AdaCore (the “Organizer”), a simplified joint stock company (“société par actions simplifiée”) under the laws of France, registered under n°403 325 657 at the registry of the Paris Tribunal of Commerce, with offices at 46 rue d’Amsterdam, 75009 Paris (France).  At the option of the Organizer, the Competition may also be sponsored by other organizations (the “Sponsors”), which would provide in-kind support for the Competition.

## Participants

### Eligibility

“Ada/SPARK Crate Of The Year” is open to both “Individual Participants” and “Team Participants” (collectively, “Participants”).

Individual Participants must be at least the age needed to legally enter into this agreement under the laws of France (18), the laws of their country of residence, and the laws of the country from which they make their entry. Sponsors and Judges (defined below) are not eligible, nor are their employees or contractors or those of the Organizer nor the family members of, and any persons living with, such individuals .

“Teams” are composed of Team Participants, each of whom must be individually eligible. Each team must designate one of its members as the “Team Lead”, who will:
be the only point of contact between the Team and the Organizer and be the recipient of all communication on behalf of the Team;
receive any prize awarded to the Team and be responsible for sharing it among the Team Participants.

## Submissions

### Vocabulary

A "Crate" is a software project, library or executable, written using the Ada and/or SPARK programming languages and contributed to the [Alire ecosystem](https://alire.ada.dev).

A "Submission" is a [GitHub "issue"](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)) that describes and promotes the Crate. The goal of the Submission is to explain to the Judges why the Crate deserves to receive one of the awards of the Competition. The expected format and content of a Submission is described below.

### Requirements

Each Individual Participant’s and each Team’s “Submission” must be in English and must contain:
 - A link to their Crate contributed to Alire package manager ecosystem
 - A technical description of the content of their Crate;
 - For “Team Participants“, a list of team members (names and GitHub logins);
 - Pictures or videos explaining the architecture, content, and making of the Crate;
 - Links to external resources, such as a repository on GitHub or other public location, containing the sources and documentation of the Crate.
 - Identification of which parts of the Crate are original and which parts, if any, are reusing content authored by third parties, such as pre-existing libraries.
 - Identification of which parts of the Crate, if any, have been submitted to a previous Ada/SPARK Crate Of The Year Competition or Make with Ada competition.
 - Code written in the Ada or SPARK languages. It can optionally use components written in other languages (such as third-party libraries), but only the original part of the Crate that uses Ada or SPARK will be evaluated by the Judges.
Initial Submissions may be made by Participants between 6:00 CEST on Monday June 28th 2021 and 23:59 CEST on Friday December 31st 2021. Submissions may be amended, corrected, or improved at any time during this period.

## How to enter
### Step 1: Get your Crate accepted to the Alire community index.
 
 - Follow the procedures from the Alire documentation to submit a “crate” in the Alire community index (Publishing Your Projects in Alire).
 - Be sure that your Crate is not rejected by the Alire team based on the criteria defined by the Alire project.

### Step 2: Open an “issue” on the [Ada/SPARK Crate Of The Year GitHub repository](https://github.com/AdaCore/Ada-SPARK-Crate-Of-The-Year).

 - The Participant Team Lead must open the “issue”.
 - The GitHub account used to open the “issue” must be one of the accounts in the “maintainers-logins” list of the crate published in the Alire community index.
 - The title of the “issue” must have the following format `[2021][<crate_name>] <crate_description>`, where:
`<crate_name>` is the name of the crate as published in the Alire community index
`<crate_description>` is a less than 60-character description of the Crate
 - The body of the “issue” should contain the Submission (see above).
 - Review your Crate and make sure it meets all the submission [requirements](#requirements).

### Step 3: Promote and update.

- Your submission is public; everyone can comment and react to it. Use their feedback to improve your submission. Remember to follow the [AdaCore Code of Conduct](https://www.adacore.com/company/code-of-conduct) when you reply to comments.
Promote your Submission on forums and social media. A popular Submission with many comments and positive feedback is more likely to win.
 - You may  edit your Submission until the last date that the  competition allows Submissions. Use the edit button on your GitHub Issue page.

## Competition

The Crates will be evaluated by a panel of AdaCore employees (the “Judges”) using information available either in the Submission or from the resources referred to by the Submission. They will evaluate it using the following criteria:  

 - Benefits for the Ada/SPARK community: How easy is it for other members of the programming community to use the Crate?  Does it have clearly-defined interfaces and documentation? Is it available in a public repository through a version control system such as svn or git? Does the public repository chosen supply a bug tracking system? Can the Crate be built with tools available to the Ada/SPARK programmer community?

 - Open source: Does the Crate have a [Free Software License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html), as defined by the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/) or an [open-source licence](https://opensource.org/osd), as defined by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org)?  Does it have an open design? Does it use open tools, hardware and platforms?

 - Software quality: Does the Crate make use of processes and technologies that provide high confidence that the software meets its requirements (for example formal methods, SPARK, contract-based programming, testing, and coding standards)? Is its documentation accurate? Are there sufficient, well-written comments within the source code to understand the Crate and the choices made in its design?

 - Buzz effect: one of the main goals of the Competition is to give more exposure to Alire, Ada, SPARK and related technologies. Crates will be judged in part with regards to how we think the Crate can have an impact in that regard: Will the Crate give more exposure to Ada or SPARK? Does it have a “wow effect” that will appeal to the technology community in general? Will it show the benefits of Ada, SPARK, and related technologies?

## Prizes

The following “Prizes” will be awarded as part of the Competition:
 - The `Ada Crate Of The Year Prize`, in the amount of 2000 (two thousand) USD to the best overall Ada Crate;
 - The `SPARK Crate Of The Year Prize`, in the amount of 2000 (two thousand) USD to the best Crate written in SPARK and/or contributing to the SPARK ecosystem;
 - The `Embedded Crate Of The Year Prize`, in the amount of 2000 (two thousand) USD to the best Ada or SPARK Crate for [embedded software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_software);

## Award of Prizes

Each Submission will first be qualified or disqualified based on the competition eligibility rules. The Judges will then select the winners of the competition from the pool of qualified submissions and award the “Ada Crate Of The Year Prize”, “SPARK Crate Of The Year Prize” and “Embedded Crate Of The Year Prize”.

Decisions of the Judges are final and binding upon all Participants and the Organizer.
The winners will be announced in January 2022 on [blog.adacore.com](http://makewithada.org) or possibly later depending on the number of entries.

## Payment or Delivery of the Prizes

The winner (or Team Lead) of each Crate Of The Year Prize will be asked to provide banking information (IBAN of SWIFT) and whether they want to be paid in EUR or USD. Payment will be made by the Organizer, in the chosen currency, within 45 days of receipt of such information. The Participant receiving the payment shall be responsible for any fee charged by his bank for such transfer and any fees for currency conversion. If the Participant requests to be paid in EUR, they acknowledge that the original USD amount of the prize will be converted to EUR at the then-current exchange rate. The Team Leads are responsible for distributing the Prize among the members of their Team.
